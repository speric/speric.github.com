</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>It is not our part to master all the tides of the world, but to do what is in us for the succour of those years wherein we are set, uprooting the evil in the fields that we know, so that those who live after may have clean earth to till. What weather they shall have is not ours to rule.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Culture is, first of all, the name for all of our relentless, restless human effort to take the world as its given to us and make something else. This is the original insight of the writer of Genesis when he says that human beings were made in God's image: just like the original Creator, we are creators.</p>

</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Feeble emotions, it seemed to me, corresponded to flaccid muscles, sentimentality to a sagging stomach, and over-impressionability to an oversensitive, white skin. Bulging muscles, a taut stomach, and a tough skin, I reasoned, would correspond respectively to an intrepid fighting spirit, the power of dispassionate intellectual judgment, and a robust disposition.</p>
  <small>Yukio Mishima</small>

<blockquote>
  <p>Now in particular I ask you to pray with me that as I baptize this child with water and receive him into the number of Christians, that God himself inwardly baptize him with his Spirit and hold him in the number of his elect.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>There are two attitudes of mind, especially, that the older man must guard against. The one is - living in the past: his accomplishments of yesteryear: fantasies as to his boyhood: his athletic or sporting successes: his high-marked examinations. To do this is to admit failure as to the present.</p>

  <p>In this age group there are still 'championships' to be won: feats of strength even outdoing the young: capacities and demonstrations just as good as he ever enjoyed, since all things are relative.</p>

  <p>The other is - projecting himself too much into the future: sacrificing today for a perhaps, nebulous, tomorrow. There must be balance.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>What are fathers called to? Fathers give. Fathers protect. Fathers bestow. Fathers yearn and long for the good of their children. Fathers delight. Fathers sacrifice. Fathers are jovial and open-handed. Fathers create abundance, and if lean times come they take the leanest portion themselves and create a sense of gratitude and abundance for the rest. Fathers love birthdays and Christmas because it provides them with yet another excuse to give some more to the kids. When fathers say no, as good fathers do from time to time, it is only because they are giving a more subtle gift, one that is a bit more complicated than a cookie. They must include among their gifts things like self-control and discipline and a work ethic, but they are giving these things, not taking something else away just for the sake of taking. Fathers are not looking for excuses to say no. Their default mode is not no.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>When he loses he always finds an excuse. But football is not possession on the ball or playing nice passes. Good football is winning games and that's what we do when we play against them.</p>
  <small>Michael Ballack, after Chelsea clinically dispatched Arsenal 2-0</small>

<blockquote>
  <p>The one essential condition of human existence is that man should always be able to bow down before something infinitely great.  If men are deprived of the infinitely great, they will not go on living and will die of despair.  The Infinite and the Eternal are as essential for man as the little planet on which he dwells.</p>

  <p>Before the time trial this past weekend one of my old team-mates dads asked me how I felt. I said "I am ready to bleed to win this thing"</p>

  <p>The big problem is not that unhappy people have less money than others. It is that they have earned less success.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Sprezzatura...a certain nonchalance, so as to conceal all art and make whatever one does or says appear to be without effort and almost without any thought about it.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Bruce had me up to three miles a day, really at a good pace. We'd run the three miles in twenty-one or twenty-two minutes. Just under eight minutes a mile [Note: when running on his own in 1968, Lee would get his time down to six-and-a half minutes per mile]. So this morning he said to me "We're going to go five." I said, Bruce, I can't go five. I'm a helluva lot older than you are, and I can't do five." He said, "When we get to three, we'll shift gears and it's only two more and you'll do it." I said "Okay, hell, I'll go for it." So we get to three, we go into the fourth mile and I'm okay for three or four minutes, and then I really begin to give out. I'm tired, my heart's pounding, I can't go any more and so I say to him, "Bruce if I run any more," and we're still running- "if I run any more I'm liable to have a heart attack and die." He said, "Then die."" It made me so mad that I went the full five miles. Afterward I went to the shower and then I wanted to talk to him about it. I said, you know, "Why did you say that?"" He said, "Because you might as well be dead. Seriously, if you always put limits on what you can do, physical or anything else, it'll spread over into the rest of your life. It'll spread into your work, into your morality, into your entire being. There are no limits. There are plateaus, but you must not stay there, you must go beyond them. If it kills you, it kills you. A man must constantly exceed his level."</p>
  <small>Don't know if this story about Bruce Lee is true or not, but I believe it</small>

  <p>In a lot of ways the code wasn't very good because it was done very fast. But it got the job done. We shipped - that was the bottom line.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In general, I enjoy reading and talking about the <i>Apes</i> movies more than I enjoy experiencing them.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I spoke only strong words and ignored weakness at every turn. I subdued my fears. I was opinionated and direct. I became a man either well loved or truly hated. I was ready for anything.</p>
  <small>Mark Twight, <i>Kiss Or Kill</i></small>

<blockquote>
  <p>This world though is based on illusion and it is easy for the individual whose job is pretending to convince himself that if he is faking then everyone is faking and that no one else has done anything genuine, that nothing is true. For that fellow hard work is not the answer: the shortcut is the answer, the way if life: "If I wear the clothes and say the words I will be the guy." It is hard to earn such a man's respect because he has none for himself, and knows deep down the illusion of his self-respect is just that.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>What I am doing right here, right now is either taking me closer to my goal or pushing me further from it. Ask which it is. Answer honestly. And then ACT on that answer.</p>
