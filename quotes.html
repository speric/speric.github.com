<blockquote>
  <p>
    I choose to live by choice, not by chance; to make changes, not excuses; to be motivated, not manipulated; to be useful, not used; to excel, not to compete. I choose self-esteem, not self-pity. I choose to listen to my inner voice, not the random opinion of others. I choose to be me.

    Life is not a journey to the grave with the intention to arrive safely in a pretty and well-preserved body,

<blockquote>
  <p>
    The books or the music in which we thought the beauty was located will betray us if we trust
    to them; it was not in them, it only came through them, and what came through them was longing.
    These things—the beauty, the memory of our own past—are good images of what we really desire;
    but if they are mistaken for the thing itself they turn into dumb idols, breaking the hearts of their
    worshipers. For they are not the thing itself; they are only the scent of a flower we have not found,
    the echo of a tune we have not heard, news from a country we have never yet visited.

  <p>
    In every life, no matter how full or empty one's purse, there is tragedy. It is the one promise
    life always fulfills. Thus, happiness is a gift and the trick is not to expect it but to delight
    in it when it comes and to add to other people's store of it.

<blockquote>
  <p>
    Among men who rise to fame and leadership two types are
    recognizable - those who are born with a belief in themselves and those
    in whom it is a slow growth dependent on actual achievement. To men of the
    last type their own success is a constant surprise, and its fruits the more
    delicious, yet to be tested cautiously with a haunting sense of doubt whether
    it is not all a dream. In that doubt lies true modesty, not the sham of
    insincere self-depreciation but the modesty of "moderation", in the Greek sense.

<blockquote>
  <p>
    A kind of second childhood falls on so many men. They trade their violence for the promise of a small increase of life span. In
    effect, the head of the house becomes the youngest child. And I have searched myself for this possibility with a kind of horror.
    For I have always lived violently, drunk hugely, eaten too much or not at all, slept around the clock or missed two nights of sleeping,
    worked too hard and too long in glory, or slobbed for a time in utter laziness. I've lifted, pulled, chopped, climbed, made love
    with joy and taken my hangovers as a consequence, not as a punishment. I did not want to surrender fierceness for a small gain in
    yardage. My wife married a man; I saw no reason why she should inherit a baby.

  <p>
    If the land mechanism as a whole is good, then every part is good, whether we understand it or not. If the
    biota, in the course of aeons, has built something we like but do not understand, then who but a fool would
    discard seemingly useless parts? To keep every cog and wheel is the first precaution of intelligent tinkering.

<blockquote>
  <p>
Let us therefore hold, that our life will be framed in best accordance with the will of God…when it is, in every respect, most advantageous to our brethren. But in the whole Law, there is not one syllable which lays down a rule as to what man is to do or avoid for the advantage of his own carnal nature. And, indeed, since men are naturally prone to excessive self-love, which they always retain, how great soever their departure from the truth may be, there was no need of a law to inflame a love already existing in excess. Hence it is perfectly plain, that the observance of the Commandments consists not in the love of ourselves, but in the love of God and our neighbour; and that he leads the best and holiest life who as little as may be studies and lives for himself; and that none lives worse and more unrighteously than he who studies and lives only for himself, and seeks and thinks only of his own.

    O Thou who seest and knowest all things, give me grace, I pray Thee, so to know Thee and so to see Thee that in knowing Thee I may know myself even as I am most perfectly known of Thee, and in seeing Thee may see myself as I verily am before Thee. Give me to-day some clear vision of my life in time as it appears to Thine eternity. Show me my own smallness and Thine infinite greatness. Show me my own sin and Thy perfect righteousness. Show me my own lovelessness and Thine exceeding love. Yet in Thy mercy show me also how, small as I am, I can take refuge in Thy greatness; how, sinful as I am, I may lean upon Thy righteousness; and how, loveless as I am, I may hide myself in Thy forgiving love. Cause my thoughts to dwell much to-day on the life and death of Jesus Christ my Lord, so that I may see all things in the light of the redemption which Thou hast granted to me in His name. Amen.

  <p>
    For success, like happiness, cannot be pursued; it must ensue, and it only does so as the unintended side-effect of one's personal dedication to a cause greater than oneself or as the by-product of one's surrender to a person other than oneself. Happiness must happen, and the same holds for success: you have to let it happen by not caring about it.

  <p>The objective is the journey, the process; the work matters. In a race you can be first, miles and miles ahead of anyone else, and then, metres from the line, fall over. And? Are you going to write that race off? You ran brilliantly. And it's far more complex than saying: win, good; don't win, bad. What enriches you is the game, not the result. The result is a piece of data. The birth rate goes up. Is that enriching? No. But the process that led to that? Now that's enriching. Fulfilment comes from the process. You debate the game not the results. Results are not debatable, they are. Do you buy a paper on a Monday morning for a euro and the only thing in it is list after list of results? Do you go into a football stadium, in the last minute of a game, have a look at the scoreboard and leave? You watch 90 minutes, which is the process. You can't validate the process through the results. Human beings tend to venerate what finished well, not what was done well. We attack what ended up badly, not what was done badly.</p>

  <p>Memories and hope are not so different; one is "having done" the other is "to do." Neither constitutes action. You are what you do; thus, if you do nothing, you are nobody.

  <p>Culture is, first of all, the name for all of our relentless, restless human effort to take the world as its given to us and make something else. This is the original insight of the writer of Genesis when he says that human beings were made in God's image: just like the original Creator, we are creators.</p>

  <p>Feeble emotions, it seemed to me, corresponded to flaccid muscles, sentimentality to a sagging stomach, and over-impressionability to an oversensitive, white skin. Bulging muscles, a taut stomach, and a tough skin, I reasoned, would correspond respectively to an intrepid fighting spirit, the power of dispassionate intellectual judgment, and a robust disposition.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>There are two attitudes of mind, especially, that the older man must guard against. The one is - living in the past: his accomplishments of yesteryear: fantasies as to his boyhood: his athletic or sporting successes: his high-marked examinations. To do this is to admit failure as to the present.</p>

  <p>In this age group there are still 'championships' to be won: feats of strength even outdoing the young: capacities and demonstrations just as good as he ever enjoyed, since all things are relative.</p>

  <p>The other is - projecting himself too much into the future: sacrificing today for a perhaps, nebulous, tomorrow. There must be balance.</p>

  <p>What are fathers called to? Fathers give. Fathers protect. Fathers bestow. Fathers yearn and long for the good of their children. Fathers delight. Fathers sacrifice. Fathers are jovial and open-handed. Fathers create abundance, and if lean times come they take the leanest portion themselves and create a sense of gratitude and abundance for the rest. Fathers love birthdays and Christmas because it provides them with yet another excuse to give some more to the kids. When fathers say no, as good fathers do from time to time, it is only because they are giving a more subtle gift, one that is a bit more complicated than a cookie. They must include among their gifts things like self-control and discipline and a work ethic, but they are giving these things, not taking something else away just for the sake of taking. Fathers are not looking for excuses to say no. Their default mode is not no.</p>

  <p>The one essential condition of human existence is that man should always be able to bow down before something infinitely great.  If men are deprived of the infinitely great, they will not go on living and will die of despair.  The Infinite and the Eternal are as essential for man as the little planet on which he dwells.</p>

  <p>Bruce had me up to three miles a day, really at a good pace. We'd run the three miles in twenty-one or twenty-two minutes. Just under eight minutes a mile [Note: when running on his own in 1968, Lee would get his time down to six-and-a half minutes per mile]. So this morning he said to me "We're going to go five." I said, Bruce, I can't go five. I'm a helluva lot older than you are, and I can't do five." He said, "When we get to three, we'll shift gears and it's only two more and you'll do it." I said "Okay, hell, I'll go for it." So we get to three, we go into the fourth mile and I'm okay for three or four minutes, and then I really begin to give out. I'm tired, my heart's pounding, I can't go any more and so I say to him, "Bruce if I run any more," and we're still running- "if I run any more I'm liable to have a heart attack and die." He said, "Then die."" It made me so mad that I went the full five miles. Afterward I went to the shower and then I wanted to talk to him about it. I said, you know, "Why did you say that?"" He said, "Because you might as well be dead. Seriously, if you always put limits on what you can do, physical or anything else, it'll spread over into the rest of your life. It'll spread into your work, into your morality, into your entire being. There are no limits. There are plateaus, but you must not stay there, you must go beyond them. If it kills you, it kills you. A man must constantly exceed his level."</p>

  <p>This world though is based on illusion and it is easy for the individual whose job is pretending to convince himself that if he is faking then everyone is faking and that no one else has done anything genuine, that nothing is true. For that fellow hard work is not the answer: the shortcut is the answer, the way if life: "If I wear the clothes and say the words I will be the guy." It is hard to earn such a man's respect because he has none for himself, and knows deep down the illusion of his self-respect is just that.</p>

  <p>When therefore we are hindered, or disturbed, or grieved, let us never attribute it to others, but to ourselves; that is, to our own principles. An uninstructed person will lay the fault of his own bad condition upon others. Someone just starting instruction will lay the fault on himself. Some who is perfectly instructed will place blame neither on others nor on himself.</p>
