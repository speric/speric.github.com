  <p>
    What would happen if I only said things I deeply believed to be true?

<blockquote>
  <p>
Let us therefore hold, that our life will be framed in best accordance with the will of Godâ€¦when it is, in every respect, most advantageous to our brethren. But in the whole Law, there is not one syllable which lays down a rule as to what man is to do or avoid for the advantage of his own carnal nature. And, indeed, since men are naturally prone to excessive self-love, which they always retain, how great soever their departure from the truth may be, there was no need of a law to inflame a love already existing in excess. Hence it is perfectly plain, that the observance of the Commandments consists not in the love of ourselves, but in the love of God and our neighbour; and that he leads the best and holiest life who as little as may be studies and lives for himself; and that none lives worse and more unrighteously than he who studies and lives only for himself, and seeks and thinks only of his own.

  <p>
    It is in our power to have no opinion about a thing, and not to be disturbed in our soul; for things themselves have no natural power to form our judgments.

<blockquote>
  <p>
    O Thou who seest and knowest all things, give me grace, I pray Thee, so to know Thee and so to see Thee that in knowing Thee I may know myself even as I am most perfectly known of Thee, and in seeing Thee may see myself as I verily am before Thee. Give me to-day some clear vision of my life in time as it appears to Thine eternity. Show me my own smallness and Thine infinite greatness. Show me my own sin and Thy perfect righteousness. Show me my own lovelessness and Thine exceeding love. Yet in Thy mercy show me also how, small as I am, I can take refuge in Thy greatness; how, sinful as I am, I may lean upon Thy righteousness; and how, loveless as I am, I may hide myself in Thy forgiving love. Cause my thoughts to dwell much to-day on the life and death of Jesus Christ my Lord, so that I may see all things in the light of the redemption which Thou hast granted to me in His name. Amen.

<blockquote>
  <p>
    For success, like happiness, cannot be pursued; it must ensue, and it only does so as the unintended side-effect of one's personal dedication to a cause greater than oneself or as the by-product of one's surrender to a person other than oneself. Happiness must happen, and the same holds for success: you have to let it happen by not caring about it.

    Seeking approval for how far one has come is a seductive trap that shifts attention backwards while the goal remains ahead.

  <p>
    I wish to testify that in my best moments I am not aware of the existence of the government. Though I respect and 
    feel myself dignified by the principles of the Declaration and the Constitution, I do not remember a day when the 
    thought of the government made me happy, and I never think of it without the wish that it might become wiser and 
    truer and smaller than it is.

  <p>Drink your wine. Laugh from your gut. Burden your moments with thankfulness. Be as empty as you can be when that clock winds down. Spend your life. And if time is a river, may you leave a wake.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We will vanish. We cannot smuggle things out with us through death. But this shouldn't inspire melancholy; it should only tinge the sweet with the bitter. Don't resent the moments simply because they cannot be frozen. Taste them. Savor them. Give thanks for that daily bread. Manna doesn't keep overnight. More will come in the morning.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The objective is the journey, the process; the work matters. In a race you can be first, miles and miles ahead of anyone else, and then, metres from the line, fall over. And? Are you going to write that race off? You ran brilliantly. And it's far more complex than saying: win, good; don't win, bad. What enriches you is the game, not the result. The result is a piece of data. The birth rate goes up. Is that enriching? No. But the process that led to that? Now that's enriching. Fulfilment comes from the process. You debate the game not the results. Results are not debatable, they are. Do you buy a paper on a Monday morning for a euro and the only thing in it is list after list of results? Do you go into a football stadium, in the last minute of a game, have a look at the scoreboard and leave? You watch 90 minutes, which is the process. You can't validate the process through the results. Human beings tend to venerate what finished well, not what was done well. We attack what ended up badly, not what was done badly.</p>

  <p>If you trust in yourself...and believe in your dreams...and follow your star...you'll still get beaten by people who spent their time working hard and learning things and weren't so lazy.</p>

</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Memories and hope are not so different; one is "having done" the other is "to do." Neither constitutes action. You are what you do; thus, if you do nothing, you are nobody. If you once did great things, you think you are great. You coast along on dead, preserved laurels, lifeless and wasting away.</p>

  <p>Therefore, be patient. Such pleasure as there is, is here, now. Take pleasure as it comes. Take work as it comes. The end may never come, or when it does it may be the wrong end.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Some things are in our control and others not. Things in our control are opinion, pursuit, desire, aversion, and, in a word, whatever are our own actions. Things not in our control are body, property, reputation, command, and, in one word, whatever are not our own actions.</p>

  <p>Your product is only a tool which lets users become awesome. Don't be engulfed by the product's awesomeness, however awesome it may be.

<blockquote>
  <p>It is not our part to master all the tides of the world, but to do what is in us for the succour of those years wherein we are set, uprooting the evil in the fields that we know, so that those who live after may have clean earth to till. What weather they shall have is not ours to rule.</p>

  <p>You will be civilized the day you can spend time doing nothing, learning nothing, and improving nothing, without feeling slightest guilt.</p>
  <small>Nicholas Nassim Taleb</small>

<blockquote>
  <p>Culture is, first of all, the name for all of our relentless, restless human effort to take the world as its given to us and make something else. This is the original insight of the writer of Genesis when he says that human beings were made in God's image: just like the original Creator, we are creators.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Feeble emotions, it seemed to me, corresponded to flaccid muscles, sentimentality to a sagging stomach, and over-impressionability to an oversensitive, white skin. Bulging muscles, a taut stomach, and a tough skin, I reasoned, would correspond respectively to an intrepid fighting spirit, the power of dispassionate intellectual judgment, and a robust disposition.</p>

  <p>Now in particular I ask you to pray with me that as I baptize this child with water and receive him into the number of Christians, that God himself inwardly baptize him with his Spirit and hold him in the number of his elect.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>There are two attitudes of mind, especially, that the older man must guard against. The one is - living in the past: his accomplishments of yesteryear: fantasies as to his boyhood: his athletic or sporting successes: his high-marked examinations. To do this is to admit failure as to the present.</p>

  <p>In this age group there are still 'championships' to be won: feats of strength even outdoing the young: capacities and demonstrations just as good as he ever enjoyed, since all things are relative.</p>

  <p>The other is - projecting himself too much into the future: sacrificing today for a perhaps, nebulous, tomorrow. There must be balance.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>What are fathers called to? Fathers give. Fathers protect. Fathers bestow. Fathers yearn and long for the good of their children. Fathers delight. Fathers sacrifice. Fathers are jovial and open-handed. Fathers create abundance, and if lean times come they take the leanest portion themselves and create a sense of gratitude and abundance for the rest. Fathers love birthdays and Christmas because it provides them with yet another excuse to give some more to the kids. When fathers say no, as good fathers do from time to time, it is only because they are giving a more subtle gift, one that is a bit more complicated than a cookie. They must include among their gifts things like self-control and discipline and a work ethic, but they are giving these things, not taking something else away just for the sake of taking. Fathers are not looking for excuses to say no. Their default mode is not no.</p>

  <p>When he loses he always finds an excuse. But football is not possession on the ball or playing nice passes. Good football is winning games and that's what we do when we play against them.</p>
  <small>Michael Ballack, after Chelsea clinically dispatched Arsenal 2-0</small>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>The one essential condition of human existence is that man should always be able to bow down before something infinitely great.  If men are deprived of the infinitely great, they will not go on living and will die of despair.  The Infinite and the Eternal are as essential for man as the little planet on which he dwells.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Bruce had me up to three miles a day, really at a good pace. We'd run the three miles in twenty-one or twenty-two minutes. Just under eight minutes a mile [Note: when running on his own in 1968, Lee would get his time down to six-and-a half minutes per mile]. So this morning he said to me "We're going to go five." I said, Bruce, I can't go five. I'm a helluva lot older than you are, and I can't do five." He said, "When we get to three, we'll shift gears and it's only two more and you'll do it." I said "Okay, hell, I'll go for it." So we get to three, we go into the fourth mile and I'm okay for three or four minutes, and then I really begin to give out. I'm tired, my heart's pounding, I can't go any more and so I say to him, "Bruce if I run any more," and we're still running- "if I run any more I'm liable to have a heart attack and die." He said, "Then die."" It made me so mad that I went the full five miles. Afterward I went to the shower and then I wanted to talk to him about it. I said, you know, "Why did you say that?"" He said, "Because you might as well be dead. Seriously, if you always put limits on what you can do, physical or anything else, it'll spread over into the rest of your life. It'll spread into your work, into your morality, into your entire being. There are no limits. There are plateaus, but you must not stay there, you must go beyond them. If it kills you, it kills you. A man must constantly exceed his level."</p>
  <small>Don't know if this story about Bruce Lee is true or not, but I believe it</small>

  <p>This world though is based on illusion and it is easy for the individual whose job is pretending to convince himself that if he is faking then everyone is faking and that no one else has done anything genuine, that nothing is true. For that fellow hard work is not the answer: the shortcut is the answer, the way if life: "If I wear the clothes and say the words I will be the guy." It is hard to earn such a man's respect because he has none for himself, and knows deep down the illusion of his self-respect is just that.</p>

  <p>When therefore we are hindered, or disturbed, or grieved, let us never attribute it to others, but to ourselves; that is, to our own principles.
