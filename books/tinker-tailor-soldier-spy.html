<br/>
<blockquote><p>At a certain moment, after all, every man chooses: will he go forward, will he go back? There was nothing dishonourable in not being blown about by every little modern wind. Better to have worth, to entrench, to be an oak of one&rsquo;s own generation.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>He loved success, but he detested miracles if they put the rest of his endeavour out of focus.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>If you ever want to get out of Switzerland in a hurry, you pay your bills first.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>Learn the facts, Steed-Asprey used to say, then try on the stories like clothes.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>A committee is an animal with four back legs.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>Survival, as Jim Prideaux liked to recall, is an infinite capacity for suspicion.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>he wondered whether there was any love between human beings that did not rest upon some sort of self-delusion;</p></blockquote>
