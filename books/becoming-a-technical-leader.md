</h2>

<br/>

> Instead of leading _people_, as in the threat/reward model, organic leadership
 leads the _process_...Leading the process is responsive to people, giving them
 choices and leaving them in control.

> People improve their performance not by amputating their old behaviors, but by adding new ones.

> To become a problem-solving leader, you don't need some sudden religious
conversion. You merely need to examine those ends/means combinations where you lack
strategies, then fill in the holes, one at a time.

> Unless and until all members of a team have a common understanding of the problem,
all attempts to solve the problem are just so much wasted energy.

> Problem-solving leaders are not interested in doing again what has already been
done well, by themselves or someone else.

> Nobody is bright enough to have all the good ideas, and a constant babble of your
own unconsidered ideas is an excellent way to discourage other people's ideas.

> All great chefs taste the food during preparation, and effective problem-solving
leaders never compromise on quality.

> Sometimes the best measurement tool is a fresh perspective on what you're doing.
