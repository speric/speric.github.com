<blockquote><p>there is a sense in which my own life is inseparable from the history and the place.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>But one immediately reflects that the American Indian, who was ignorant by the same standards, nevertheless knew how to live in the country without making violence the invariable mode of his relation to it; in fact, from the ecologist's or the conservationist's point of view, he did it no violence. This is because he had, in place of what we would call education, a fully integrated culture, the content of which was a highly complex sense of his dependence on the earth.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>The idea was that when faced with abundance one should consume abundantly -an idea that has survived to become the basis of our present economy. It is neither natural nor civilized, and even from a "practical" point of view it is to the last degree brutalizing and stupid.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>We still have not, in any meaningful way, arrived in America. And in spite of our great reservoir of facts and methods, in comparison to the deep earthly wisdom of established peoples we still know but little.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>A road, on the other hand, even the most primitive road, embodies a resistance against the landscape. Its reason is not simply the necessity for movement, but haste. Its wish is to avoid contact with the landscape; it seeks so far as possible to go over the country, rather than through it; its aspiration, as we see clearly in the example of our modern freeways, is to be a bridge; its tendency is to translate place into space in order to traverse it with the least effort. It is</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>Its form is the form of speed, dissatisfaction, and anxiety. It represents the ultimate in engineering sophistication, but the crudest possible valuation of life in this world.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>Therefore, be patient. Such pleasure as there is, is here, now. Take pleasure as it comes. Take work as it comes. The end may never come, or when it does it may be the wrong end.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>&quot;Public&quot; and &quot;community,&quot; then, are different-perhaps radically different -concepts that under certain circumstances are compatible but that, in the present economic and technological monoculture, tend to be at odds. A community, when it is alive and well, is centered on the household-the family place and economy -and the household is centered on marriage. A public, when it is working in the best way-that is, as a political body intent on justice - is centered on the individual. Community and public alike, then, are founded on respect -the one on respect for the family, the other on respect for the individual.</p></blockquote>
