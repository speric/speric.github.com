<h2><a href="http://www.amazon.com/obidos/ASIN/B004IK8PIW/prudedigit-20">Lean Architecture: for Agile Software Development</a> by James O. Coplien and Gertrud Bjornvig</h2>
<br/>
<blockquote><p>A well-considered system keeps evolving so everybody wins.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>It is imperative because, on a human scale, it is a scandal to sacrifice development staff comfort to end user comfort.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>Just because things are simple doesn&rsquo;t mean they are simplistic.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>Lean&rsquo;s primary focus is the enterprise value stream. Lean grabs the consumer world and pulls it through the value stream to the beginnings of development, so that every subsequent activity adds value. Waste in production reduces value; constant improvement increases value.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>Architecture represents the significant design decisions that shape a system, where significant is measured by cost of change.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>However, one of the great paradoxes of Lean is that such intensity at the beginning of a project, with heavy iteration and rework in design, actually reduces overall life cycle cost and improves product quality. Apply those principles to software, and you have a lightweight up-front architecture.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>Lean architecture is about doing what&rsquo;s important now that will keep you in the game for the long term.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>Lean architecture also adopts the perspective that standards are valuable, but again: at the level of form, protocols, and APIs, rather than their implementation.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>The code is the design.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>Agile understands that nothing lasts forever, and it instead focuses explicitly on what is likely to change.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>System architecture should reflect the end users&rsquo; mental model of their world.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>Deferring interactions with stakeholders, or deferring decisions beyond the responsible moment slows progress, raises cost, and increases frustration. A team acts like a team from the start.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>Going beyond this expression of form with too much structure (such as class implementation) is not Lean, slows things down, and leads to rework.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>If we were to look at Lean and Agile through a coarse lens, we&rsquo;d discover that Agile is about doing and that Lean is about thinking (about continuous process improvement) and doing.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>Everybody, All together, Early On</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>We go to the code for what and how, but only the authors or their documentation tell us why.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>People appreciate being invited to the party early. And remember the Lean Secret: everybody, all together, from early on.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>The what-the-system-is part relates to what is commonly called the architecture or platform: the part that reflects the stable structures of the business over time.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>We like Jerry Weinberg&rsquo;s definition of problem: the difference between the current state and a desired state.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>great projects start with a visionary and vision rather than a market analysis.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>It&rsquo;s not that form follows function, but function and form weave together into a real structure that we call member data and methods.3</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>Think of domain expertise as a broadening of user expertise into the realms of all stakeholders taken together. Expert developers learn over time what the fundamental building blocks of a given system should be.</p></blockquote>
