<h2><a href="http://www.amazon.com/obidos/ASIN/B003WEAI4E/prudedigit-20">How To Win Friends And Influence People</a> by Dale Carnegie</h2>

<br/>
<blockquote><p>Criticism is futile because it puts a person on the defensive and usually makes him strive to justify himself. Criticism is dangerous, because it wounds a person&rsquo;s precious pride, hurts his sense of importance, and arouses resentment.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t criticize them; they are just what we would be under similar circumstances.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>When dealing with people, let us remember we are not dealing with creatures of logic. We are dealing with creatures of emotion, creatures bristling with prejudices and motivated by pride and vanity.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;I will speak ill of no man,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo; &hellip; and speak all the good I know of everybody.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>It was not that I did not love you; it was that I expected too much of youth. I was measuring you by the yardstick of my own years.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>I am afraid I have visualized you as a man. Yet as I see you now, son, crumpled and weary in your cot, I see that you are still a baby. Yesterday you were in your mother&rsquo;s arms, your head on her shoulder. I have asked too much, too much.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>Instead of condemning people, let&rsquo;s try to understand them. Let&rsquo;s try to figure out why they do what they do. That&rsquo;s a lot more profitable and intriguing than criticism; and it breeds sympathy, tolerance and kindness. &ldquo;To know all is to forgive all.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>Dr. Dewey said that the deepest urge in human nature is &ldquo;the desire to be important.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>If you tell me how you get your feeling of importance, I&rsquo;ll tell you what you are. That determines your character. That is the most significant thing about you.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>If some people are so hungry for a feeling of importance that they actually go insane to get it, imagine what miracle you and I can achieve by giving people honest appreciation this side of insanity.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>Try leaving a friendly trail of little sparks of gratitude on your daily trips. You will be surprised how they will set small flames of friendship that will be rose beacons on your next visit.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>Let&rsquo;s cease thinking of our accomplishments, our wants. Let&rsquo;s try to figure out the other person&rsquo;s good points. Then forget flattery. Give honest, sincere appreciation. Be &ldquo;hearty in your approbation and lavish in your praise,&rdquo; and people will cherish your words and treasure them and repeat them over a lifetime&mdash;repeat them years after you have forgotten them.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>bait the hook to suit the fish.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>First, arouse in the other person an eager want. He who can do this has the whole world with him. He who cannot walks a lonely way.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>Here is one of the best bits of advice ever given about the fine art of human relationships. &ldquo;If there is any one secret of success,&rdquo; said Henry Ford, &ldquo;it lies in the ability to get the other person&rsquo;s point of view and see things from that person&rsquo;s angle as well as from your own.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>The world is full of people who are grabbing and self-seeking. So the rare individual who unselfishly tries to serve others has an enormous advantage.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;People who can put themselves in the place of other people, who can understand the workings of their minds, need never worry about what the future has in store for them.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>Most people go through college and learn to read Virgil and master the mysteries of calculus without ever discovering how their own minds function.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>William Winter once remarked that &ldquo;self-expression is the dominant necessity of human nature.&rdquo; Why can&rsquo;t we adapt this same psychology to business dealings? When we have a brilliant idea, instead of making others think it is ours, why not let them cook and stir the idea themselves. They will then regard it as their own; they will like it and maybe eat a couple of helpings of it.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>You knew by some divine instinct that you can make more friends in two months by becoming genuinely interested in other people than you can in two years by trying to get other people interested in you.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;It is the individual who is not interested in his fellow men who has the greatest difficulties in life and provides the greatest injury to others. It is from among such individuals that all human failures spring.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>If we want to make friends, let&rsquo;s put ourselves out to do things for other people&mdash;things that require time, energy, unselfishness and thoughtfulness.</p></blockquote>
