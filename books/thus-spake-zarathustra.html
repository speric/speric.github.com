<h2><a href="http://www.amazon.com/obidos/ASIN/B0082USJ9Y/prudedigit-20">Thus Spake Zarathustra</a> by Friedrich Nietzsche</h2>

<br/>

<blockquote><p>I conjure you, my brethren, REMAIN TRUE TO THE EARTH, and believe not those who speak unto you of superearthly hopes! Poisoners are they, whether they know it or not.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>Verily, a polluted stream is man. One must be a sea, to receive a polluted stream without becoming impure. Lo, I teach you the Superman: he is that sea; in him can your great contempt be submerged.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>What is the greatest thing ye can experience? It is the hour of great contempt. The hour in which even your happiness becometh loathsome unto you, and so also your reason and virtue.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>I love those who do not first seek a reason beyond the stars for going down and being sacrifices, but sacrifice themselves to the earth, that the earth of the Superman may hereafter arrive.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>I love him who reserveth no share of spirit for himself, but wanteth to be wholly the spirit of his virtue: thus walketh he as spirit over the bridge.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>I love him who scattereth golden words in advance of his deeds, and always doeth more than he promiseth: for he seeketh his own down-going.</p></blockquote>
