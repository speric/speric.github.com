<h2><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0199549893/prudedigit-20">The
  Forstye Saga: In Chancery</a> by John Galsworth</h2>

<br/>


<blockquote><p>He fell, indeed, year by year into a more and more detached and brotherly attitude towards his own son and daughters, treating them with a sort of whimsical equality. When he went down to Harrow to see Jolly, he never quite knew which of them was the elder, and would sit eating cherries with him out of one paper bag, with an affectionate and ironical smile twisting up an eyebrow and curling his lips a little.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>They knew they would stand by each other in scrapes, but there was no need to talk about it.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>For Jolly was forming himself unconsciously on a set
  whose motto was: 'We defy you to bore us. Life isn't half long enough,
and we're going to talk faster and more crisply, do more and know more,
and dwell less on any subject than you can possibly imagine. We are
"the best - made of wire and whipcord.' And Val was unconsciously forming himself on a set whose motto was: 'We defy you to interest or excite us. We have had every sensation, or if we haven't, we pretend we have. We are so exhausted with living that no hours are too small for us. We will lose our shirts with equanimity. We have flown fast and are past everything. All is cigarette smoke. Bismillah!'</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>"You can't have a reasonable answer. Reason has nothing to do with it. You can only have the brutal truth: I would rather die."</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>"Do you ever think that I found out my mistake - my
  hopeless, terrible mistake - the very first week of our marriage; that
I went on trying three years - you know I went on trying? Was it for myself?"</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>He felt philosophic in Paris, the edge of irony sharpened; life took on a subtle, purposeless meaning, became a bunch of flavours tasted, a darkness shot with shifting gleams of light.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>No woman, so far as he remembered, had ever inspired in him this special sensuous and yet impersonal sensation. He was going to sit and feast his eyes, and come away knowing her no better, but ready to go and feast his eyes again to-morrow.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>There was not a single memory in which anger played a part; not one reconciliation, because there had never been a rupture; nor one heart-to-heart confidence, not even when Jolly's mother died. Nothing but half-ironical affection. He had been too afraid of committing himself in any direction, for fear of losing his liberty, or interfering with that of his boy.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>...whom he looked on as the embodiment of Nature and of Beauty...</p></blockquote>
