Listen...people be askin' me all the time,<br/>
"Yo Mos, what's gettin' ready to happen with Hip-Hop?"<br/>
Where do you think Hip-Hop is goin'?<br/>
I tell em, "You know what's gonna happen with Hip-Hop?<br/>
Whatever's happening with us."<br/>
If we smoked out, Hip-Hop is gonna be smoked out<br/>
If we doin alright, Hip-Hop is gonna be doin' alright<br/>
People talk about Hip-Hop like it's some giant livin' in the hillside<br/>
comin' down to visit the townspeople<br/>
We are Hip-Hop<br/>
Me, you, everybody, we are Hip-Hop<br/>
So Hip-Hop is goin' where we goin'<br/>
So the next time you ask yourself where Hip-Hop is goin<br/>
ask yourself: "Where am I goin'? How am I doin'?"<br/>

<p>The "Rails is dead" meme has been around for a few years, and
it's been picking up steam again recently. Even among those who still
profess their love for Rails, it seems like some aren't excited about
Rails 5.  One <a href="http://naildrivin5.com/blog/2016/05/17/announcing-rails-6-an-imagined-roadmap.html?hn=826">recent post</a> even imagines what a Rails 6 that recaptures
the imagination would be like.</p>

<p>I make a living working with Rails, so this discussion interests me on a
personal level. What does the future hold for Rails? With frameworks like Phoenix gaining in mindshare, is Rails
finally dead?</p>

<p>What these discussions leave out is the fact that we are Rails. Rails will die when we stop using it.  To put it another way:
Rails will stay alive as long as we continue to choose it for
projects.</p>

<p>There's isn't an official "Language and Framework Committee" that
decides which technologies are dead. Our small choices, when aggregated,
determine the fate of technologies.</p>

<p>So is Rails dead? I don't know. It's not dead for me: I love Rails and will continue to use it. But the larger point is that no one gets to tell you that Rails is dead; you need to decide that for
yourself.</p>
