title: In Praise Of Effort

<p><blockquote>"If a thing is worth doing, it is worth doing badly." -
G.K. Chesterton</blockquote></p>

<p>Newton's first law of motion states that objects in motion
tend to stay in motion, and objects at rest tend to stay at rest, unless
acted on by an external force. This law articulates a reason behind an
opinion I've adopted: starting <i>something</i> is difficult. Of course
finishing, and finishing well, are also difficult. But I think that
first leap, from doing <i>nothing</i> to <i>something</i>, is
harder.</p>

<p>Talk is cheap. It costs nothing to say you will do <i>something</i>. And people love to talk about the amazing plans they have. But
there's a price to putting forth an effort. Doing <i>something</i>
means not doing other things. It's a sacrifice of time, sometimes with
family, oftentimes of activities that are themselves enriching. Doing
<i>something</i> means there will an end product, which can be (and
often is)
criticized. So there's also the emotional price which can
must be paid.</p>

<p>Additionally, you have those laws of motion working against you. It
seems to be our nature, that when we're doing nothing, we tend to
continue to do nothing. There's also some <a
href="https://vimeo.com/5895898">Lizard Brain</a> stuff going on too. So to go from doing <i>nothing</i> to
<i>something</i>, an outside force is needed. As you mature you realize
that in many cases, you need to be your own outside force. You come
to understand that you're fighting against yourself to get stuff done.
A self-motivated person is one who understands that, and doesn't need
(or wait for) someone to give them a push.</p>

<p>If you're part of an organization, you can see this play out everytime you have some sort of housekeeping meeting. Ask for
feedback on an issue, watch the hands go up. Everyone likes to talk
about how things should change, what they would do if they were in
charge. Ask for volunteers to work on implementing that change, or watch the
follow-up effort by folks who just "do stuff", and it's usually
disappointing.</p>

<p>Therefore, I am one who praises effort, even effort that
results in something of low quality, because I appreciate how hard it is
to do <i>something</i>. Especially when that effort is the beginning of
<i>something</i>. When I see someone attempt to organize an event
and fail, ship a software product that I find ridiculous, start a
workout program, or many other things like that, I will always admire the
effort. At least they are trying. People who offer nothing other than words
shouldn't criticize the people actually doing <i>something</i>.</p>

<p>The only time effort itself should be criticized is if it's sub-par. One should always aim for excellence. But excellence is hard to achieve, especially at the beginning of a thing. So as long as someone is trying as best as they can, and working to improve, their effort should be praised.</p>

<p>Poor outcomes are tolerated on the way to better outcomes, but poor effort is never tolerated.</p>
