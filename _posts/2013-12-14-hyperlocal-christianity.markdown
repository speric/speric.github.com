<p>David Fitch has posted a thought-provoking article at his blog entitled <a href="http://www.reclaimingthemission.com/?p=4216">The Lesson of Driscollâ€™s Plagiarism: A Rant On Rejecting Celebrity Leadership</a>. If you want the background, you'll have to read it in his article or elsewhere. At any rate, his post got me thinking about the issue of "celebrity pastors", whether or not it's a problem, and if it's a problem, what we should do about it.</p>

<p>There have always been and will always be famous Christians. A great thing about our covenantal heritage is that we have examples, all the way back to our patriarchal forefathers, of men and women who lived well before the face of God.  In the Bible, <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Hebrews+11">Hebrews 11</a>, among many other passages, sets these saints before us, including but not limited to Abel, Noah, Abraham, Sarah, Jacob, Joseph, Moses, Gideon, Barak, Samson, Jephthah, David, Samuel and the prophets. In post-biblical history we have figures like Augustine, John Huss, John Calvin, Martin Luther, John Bunyan, Robert Murray M'Cheyne, Jonathan Edwards, David Brainerd, Dietrich Bonhoeffer, Corrie ten Boom, Joni Erickson-Tada, Jim Eliot, and many countless others who belongs to the great story of our faith, and who, I believe, will be known for many generations after we're all dead. So there really can't be anything wrong with principle of a "famous Christian".</p>

<p>But the phenomenon of "celebrity pastors" is certainly up for debate. One could argue that gifted preachers benefit not only their local church, but the global church, and that they are justified in doing things like writing tons of books and putting out all sorts of media. On the other hand, pastors are given primarily for the local church, and the bulk of their efforts should be in shepherding the people who are members of their congregation.  When I was training for the eldership, Pastor Bill Shishko gave an admonishment I repeat to myself often: an elder should have his hands in the wool of the sheep. Like a good shepherd, he should be among the flock, getting dirty, getting to know each sheep. The office of pastor, or "teaching elder" is different from a "ruling elder" in that the bulk of his time should be spent in the Word, preparing to preach every Sunday. Nevertheless, a pastor himself the under-shepherd of the Great Shepherd, and so should also have his hands in the wool of the sheep as well.</p>

<p>In some ways, it's inevitable that a good preacher will become popular, if only locally. Such is the paucity of biblical preaching in our day that when a man preaches the entire counsel of God faithfully, in a winsome way that is relatable, people will eventually find him. Even if he doesn't want to be found. But I digress.</p>

<p>Fitch's article ended with the question of what do we do with celebrity pastor culture? If it's bad, how do we reject it? Let's assume that there is a problem. My suggestion is to practice hyperlocal Christianity.</p>

<h3>Hyperlocal Christianity: A Proposal</h3>

<p>I'm assuming that you are a committed member of a local church. If you're not, stop church hopping and put down some roots. Commit to a church that preaches the Gospel. Take vows, become a member. Get to know people.</p>

<p>I now propose that you go a week, a month, a year without listening to a sermon from a pastor other than your own. Get into the flow of his sermon series. Make a genuine effort to track with his ideas. Think about them during the week, talk about them when you get together with your friends. Eagerly anticipate Sunday morning worship, and the "meal" you're about to receive.</p>

<p>Don't attend a conference unless your church is putting it on. Stop reading "discernment blogs". Stay away from Christian "news". The best way to reject celebrity culture is to, you know, reject it. The idea here is to immerse yourself in your local church, and focus on what's going on there, both in the idea space and the meat space.</p>

<p>It's not that the above things are bad. They're just distracting.</p>
