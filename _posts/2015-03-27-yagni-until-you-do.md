title: YAGNI...Until You Do

<p><a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/You_aren%27t_gonna_need_it">YAGNI</a>
is a useful principle for software development. But sometimes I like to give my future self the
option to remove something that, it turns out, wasn't needed after all,
rather than being in the position of needing something that I
currently don't have.</p>

<p>I violate YAGNI most often with data rather than code itself, which
might not even be a violation of YAGNI. When
building a new feature, I am inclined to save a ton of data about
whatever <i>could</i> be useful in the future, even if I am unsure <i>how</i> it could
be useful. If, in a year, I still haven't figured out what do to
with it, then I can blow it away. But I've not yet been in a situation
where I had too much data. I have been in a situation where I wish I had
more data.</p>
