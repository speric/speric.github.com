title: "Learning vim"
---
<p>I've spent the last 6 months all-in with vim. At Chargify, we use vim when doing remote pairing, so it's been necessary to get up to speed for that reason alone. However, to shorten the learning curve I uninstalled TextMate on my personal laptop and have been using vim for all <a href="https://talentsoup.com">TalentSoup</a> development as well. My vim knowledge was basic when I joined Chargify, and while I am far from expert at this point, I am productive and learning more each day.</p>

<p>Given the experience of needing to go from 0 to productive in a short period, I'd offer that the best way to learn vim is with someone else. Whether you use someone's dotfiles (I use a fork of my colleague Jeremy Rowe's <a href="https://github.com/jeremywrowe/dotfiles">dotfiles</a>) or not is a secondary concern. Nothing will speed up your vim education like having someone watch you attempt to do something, and suggest another, more efficient way. A great set of dotfiles is super helpful, but more important is that you have someone offering guidance.</p>

<p>More and more I am becoming convinced that the pairing model is the best way to get better at software development. If you can find someone to be a mentor to you, you're in a great spot.</p>

<p>P.S. - If you can't find someone to pair with to learn vim, I recommend watching the <a

screencasts. You'll see Gary do a lot of crazy things, which will lead
you to ask "how did he do [X]", which will start you on the right
path.</p>
