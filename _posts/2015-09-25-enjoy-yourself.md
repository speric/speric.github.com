choice to be happy."

<p>I have observed a rather unsettling habit in myself: no sooner do
I achieve a goal, or acquire something I have been working towards,
than I begin to worry about losing what I have just acquired.</p>

<p>This feeling is not entirely out of place. After all, if we value our own time and energy enough to spend it in pursuit of some end, it
naturally follows that what was achieved is worth holding on to.</p>

<p>But I've noticed a tendency to let this "good anxiety" get out of
control.  It slowly builds until I can't relax anymore.</p>

<p>What I've realized is that much of my happiness, "our" happiness,
is a function of making a conscious choice to responsibly ignore
worrying about the future. Worrying about the future is useful
inasmuch as it results in responsibly planning for the future.
For example, heart disease runs in my family. My father was only a few
years older than I am now when he needed emergency surgery for an
artery blockage. I do worry about that happening to me, and because of
that worry I've made exercising and eating (mostly) healthy a priority.</p>

<p>Similarly, worrying about financing college for your kids, or your
own retirement, is a good reason to save money now. But there comes a point where I accept the fact that I've done, or am doing, all that's in my power.  There are things I cannot control, and I can't worry about those things. I will work as hard as I can, exercise, eat well, save money, etc., but I can't control the economy, or my own genetics. So why worry?</p>

<p>When I stop worrying about losing what I have, and instead focus on
enjoying what I have while it lasts, I find that I am able to conquer
anxiety and truly live "in the moment."</p>
