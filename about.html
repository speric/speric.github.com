    <p>I'm a software developer working remotely for <a href="https://chargify.com">Chargify</a>. I work mainly with Ruby on Rails and Javascript. I have a <a href="https://www.briefs.fm/speric">micro-podcast</a>. I live on Long Island, New York, with my wife, our children, and our dog <a href="https://www.instagram.com/ruby.grill/">Ruby</a>.</p>

        <h3><a href="https://talentsoup.com">TalentSoup</a></h3>
        <p>Sole developer for TalentSoup, a marketplace connecting talent (actors, actresses, models) with producers of advertising imagery. Built using Rails (from 2.3 to 3.2), MySQL, Apache + Phusion Passenger. This was the first big app I built with Rails. I learned how to manage a growing codebase, implement subscription billing (using Chargify of course), use S3 for photo hosting, and set up Graphite + statsd for analytics. In addition, I was responsible for all server and database administration.</p>

        <p>Built for TalentSoup.  A project management app for photo producers. My first attempt at a multi-tenant architecture (ala Basecamp). Similar stack to TalentSoup (Rails 3.2, MySQL, etc.) but running on nginx instead of Apache.</p>

        <h3><a href="https://bark.us">Bark</a></h3>
        <p>Worked remotely as a consultant helping to build out Bark's MVP. My main areas of focus were implementing the subscription (Stripe) and referral pieces. I also implemented a few different providers using the <a href="https://github.com/omniauth/omniauth">OmniAuth</a> library.</p>

        <p>I love reading, and collecting quotes. The highlighting feature on the Kindle is nice, but there's no API to get at your own highlights, so I built a Ruby gem to scrape Amazon's Kindle site for my highlights.</p>

        <h3><a href="https://help.chargify.com/products/product-coupons.html">Chargify Multiple Coupons</a></h3>
        <p>
          Previously, a Chargify subscription could only have one "active" coupon. This limited our merchants' ability to customize their product offerings.
          With the multi-coupon feature, merchants can "stack" multiple coupons on a subscription. A coupon can discount either "full-price", or "compound" with other
          coupons. In addition to leading the project, my work on this feature was mainly in the back-end: reworking the data model and coupon discount calculators. Like
          the "component price-point" work, I also spent time cleaning up code that no longer made sense given the new data model relationships, and ensuring backwards
          compatibility with the API.

        <h3><a href="https://www.chargify.com/blog/pricing-tools-for-complex-subscription-pricing-strategies/">Chargify Component Price Points</a></h3>
        <p>
          Previously, components (think subscription "add-ons") could only have one set of prices. With component price points, merchants can have multiple sets of prices for the same component. For example, they can have an "MSRP" set of prices for Widget, and a "Wholesale" set of prices for Widget. All revenue, for both of Widget's "price points", would be reported under the Widget component. This gives merchants more pricing options with less overhead, since they don't need to create a different component for what is essentially the same service, just to achieve pricing flexibility. In addition to leading the project, my work on this feature was mainly in the back-end: reworking the data model and component cost calculators, cleaning up code that no longer made sense given the new data model relationships, and ensuring backwards compatibility with the API. I did a little bit of the React front-end as well.

        <h3><a href="https://www.chargify.com/blog/revenue-retention-analytics">Chargify Revenue Retention Analytics</a></h3>
        <p>
          Gives merhcants insight into the performance and efficiency of dunning strategy. We hooked into the dunning lifecycle to generate data, which was then persisted into Elasticsearch. When viewing revenue retention analytics, that data is read back out by Rails
          and turned into props for the ReactJS front-end. I worked mostly on the Rails and Elasticsearch pieces of this feature, with a small bit of React.

        <h3><a href="https://www.chargify.com/blog/mrr-analytics/">Chargify MRR Analytics</a></h3>
        <p>
          Gives merhcants insight into their MRR (monthly recurring revenue). We hooked into relevant events in Chargify to generate
          MRR data, which is then persisted into Elasticsearch. When viewing MRR analytics, that MRR data is read back out by Rails
          and turned into props for the ReactJS front-end. I worked on the entire "stack" for this project: Rails, Elasticsearch, and React.

        <h3><a href="https://www.chargify.com/blog/configuring-multiple-webhook-endpoints/">Chargify Multiple Webhook Endpoint Configurations</a></h3>
        <p>Allows merchants to configure the webhook events each endpoint receives, individually. The previous implementation had one list of subscribed webhook events, and each webhook received the same events. My first production ReactJS code.</p>

        <h3><a href="https://chargify.com/blog/shopify-orders/">Chargify Shopify Integration v2</a></h3>
        <p>Enhanced Chargify's existing Shopify integration by adding the ability for Chargify to automatically create new Shopify orders for merchants whenever a new customer signed up to a plan, or their subscription renewed. This was accomplished with a combination of Chargify's own <a href="https://docs.chargify.com/webhooks"/>webhooks</a> and Shopify's Orders API. The integration is a separate app that, when enabled for a merchant, would receive webhooks whenever a Chargify statement was settled for their site, and then enqueue them for processing. Once processed, the webhook data would be transformed into the body of a proper Shopify Order, and created via the API.</p>

        <h3><a href="https://www.chargify.com/blog/notifications-dashboard/">Chargify Notifications Dashboard</a></h3>
        <p>An internal API and external interface that allows Chargify admins to send notifications to merchants with various levels of granularity (e.g. "send this message to all admins of Acme Online") or ("send this message to the owner of every site in the Chargify database"). Useful for communicating things like problems with subscription processing, new features, or upcoming API changes.</p>
