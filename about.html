<h2>About</h2>

<div class="row">
  <div class="span12">
    <p>
      I am currently the Director of Engineering, Platform at <a href="https://abstract.com">Abstract</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
      In past roles, I've gained experience as an IC and engineering manager working in payment processing,
      social networking, finance, e-commerce, and marketing contexts utilizing a
      variety of programming languages, frameworks, and stacks.
    </p>

    <p>
      I have extensive experience using Ruby on Rails, React, Javascript, and
      Elasticsearch to build large-scale web applications, with an emphasis on
      well-tested, thoughtfully-designed code.
    </p>

    <p>
      As an engineering manager, I strive to build teams based on trust,
      clear communication, empathy, shared technical approaches, personal
      autonomy, and continual improvement.

        <h3><a href="https://github.com/speric/kindle-highlights">kindle-highlights</a></h3>
        <p>
          I love reading, and collecting quotes. The highlighting feature on the Kindle is nice,
          but there's no API to get at your own highlights, so I built a Ruby gem to scrape
          Amazon's Kindle site for my highlights.

        <h3><a href="https://www.chargify.com/blog/relationship-invoicing/">Chargify Relationship Invoicing</a></h3>
        <p>
          In order to meet the demands of our customers for a more flexible approach to
          billing and invoice presentment, Chargify completely redesigned the way we handle
          subscription billing. This included adding the ability to define customer hierarchies,
          and allowing a customer to pay for a subscription that did not belong to them. This
          feature is essentially like replacing engine of a car while it was running. My role in
          this effort, as the Core Billing team lead, is to my team member are set up for success.
          This includes interfacing with our product and customer success managers, as well as
          the CTO, to work through the design and implementation of individual features, and the
          architecture as a whole.
        </p>

        <p>
          Additionally, as an Individual Contributor, I am involved in the development of various
          parts of this re-architecture, using Rails, React, and Elasticsearch.

        <h3><a href="https://www.chargify.com/blog/rapid-offer-builder-release/">Chargify Rapid Offer Builder</a></h3>
        <p>
          The Rapid Offer Builder allows Chargify merchants to preconfigure an Offer, which is made up of a product,
          any component combination on any of their price points, and coupons. Merchants can then configure their
          Public Signup Pages to use these Offers, allowing easy signup without burdening customers with choosing
          components and adding coupons. Additionally, Offers greatly simplify creating a Subscription via the
          Chargify API, since API users need only send an Offer's ID over the wire, instead of various
          product/coupon/component attributes. I contributed across the whole project, while focusing mainly on the changes
          needed to create Subscriptions from an Offer alone, and the changes needed for our Public Signup Pages to work with Offers.

        <h3><a href="https://www.chargify.com/blog/subscriber-insights-product-filters/">Chargify Filtered Subscriber Analytics</a></h3>
        <p>
          The first iteration of the dataset that drove Chargify's Subscriber Analytics did not give uers the ability to filter by products.
          As such, a user could only see how many subscribers churned across all their products, but within an arbitrary subset of
          products. Additionally, there was no way to see how many existing subscribers switched between products. Our efforts
          centered around introducing a new dataset, powered by Elasticsearch, that would yield such insights. In addition to playing
          the team lead role, I worked extensively on the data model and the back-end work necessary derive the data we needed from application events. We joked that
          we spent 2.5 months working on a dropdown, but it took a lot of work to build the dataset we needed to make the product filtering dropdown a reality.

        <h3><a href="https://www.chargify.com/blog/stacked-promotions/">Chargify Multiple Coupons</a></h3>
        <p>
          Previously, a Chargify subscription could only have one "active" coupon. This limited our merchants' ability to customize their product offerings.
          With the multi-coupon feature, merchants can "stack" multiple coupons on a subscription. A coupon can discount either "full-price", or "compound" with other
          coupons. In addition to leading the project, my work on this feature was mainly in the back-end: reworking the data model and coupon discount calculators. Like
          the "component price-point" work, I also spent time cleaning up code that no longer made sense given the new data model relationships, and ensuring backwards
          compatibility with the API.

        <h3><a href="https://www.chargify.com/blog/pricing-tools-for-complex-subscription-pricing-strategies/">Chargify Component Price Points</a></h3>
        <p>
          Previously, components (think subscription "add-ons") could only have one set of prices. With component price points, merchants can have multiple sets of prices for the same component. For example, they can have an "MSRP" set of prices for Widget, and a "Wholesale" set of prices for Widget. All revenue, for both of Widget's "price points", would be reported under the Widget component. This gives merchants more pricing options with less overhead, since they don't need to create a different component for what is essentially the same service, just to achieve pricing flexibility. In addition to leading the project, my work on this feature was mainly in the back-end: reworking the data model and component cost calculators, cleaning up code that no longer made sense given the new data model relationships, and ensuring backwards compatibility with the API. I did a little bit of the React front-end as well.
          Here's a nice write-up at TechCrunch about the feature: <a href="http://tcrn.ch/2GFI34w">http://tcrn.ch/2GFI34w</a>.

        <p>
          Gives merhcants insight into the performance and efficiency of dunning strategy. We hooked into the dunning lifecycle to generate data, which was then persisted into Elasticsearch. When viewing revenue retention analytics, that data is read back out by Rails
          and turned into props for the ReactJS front-end. I worked mostly on the Rails and Elasticsearch pieces of this feature, with a small bit of React.

        <p>
          Gives merhcants insight into their MRR (monthly recurring revenue). We hooked into relevant events in Chargify to generate
          MRR data, which is then persisted into Elasticsearch. When viewing MRR analytics, that MRR data is read back out by Rails
          and turned into props for the ReactJS front-end. I worked on the entire "stack" for this project: Rails, Elasticsearch, and React.

        <h3><a href="https://chargify.com/blog/shopify-orders/">Chargify Shopify Integration v2</a></h3>
        <p>Enhanced Chargify's existing Shopify integration by adding the ability for Chargify to automatically create new Shopify orders for merchants whenever a new customer signed up to a plan, or their subscription renewed. This was accomplished with a combination of Chargify's own <a href="https://docs.chargify.com/webhooks"/>webhooks</a> and Shopify's Orders API. The integration is a separate app that, when enabled for a merchant, would receive webhooks whenever a Chargify statement was settled for their site, and then enqueue them for processing. Once processed, the webhook data would be transformed into the body of a proper Shopify Order, and created via the API.</p>

Built using Rails (from 2.3 to 3.2), MySQL, Apache + Phusion Passenger. This was the first big app I built with Rails. I learned how to manage a growing codebase, implement subscription billing (using Chargify of course), use S3 for photo hosting, and set up Graphite + statsd for analytics. In addition, I was responsible for all server and database administration.</p>
