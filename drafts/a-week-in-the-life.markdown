title: A Week In The Life
---
<p>I received a lot of feedback, via <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4044044">Hacker News</a>, Twitter, and email, from my post titled <a href="http://ericfarkas.com/posts/how-to-do-a-startup-on-the-side-and-not-lose-your-family/">How To Do A Startup On The Side And Not Lose Your Family</a>.  Based on the questions people have been asking, I have a lot of ideas for future posts.  Today, I want to discuss "a week in the life" of a guy with a full-time job, doing a startup on the side, with a wife and kids, and other interests.  As with my last post, this is simply my <a href="http://epistemocrat.blogspot.com/">n=1</a> experience.  What follows is not meant to be prescriptive, but rather descriptive.  I have my own blind spots, and much room for improvement.</p>

<h3>Thursday, May 31</h3>
6:00am - Wake up.  Check email and site status (new subscription stats, nightly reports, etc.).  I'm trying to get away from checking email first thing in the morning.
6:30am - Head into my garage gym, workout for 30 mins.  Did some <a href="http://www.t-nation.com/free_online_article/sports_body_training_performance/rebuild_yourself_with_complexes">barbell complexes</a>.
7:00am - Shower, get dressed, take the garbage out, etc.
7:45am - Arrive at work.
12:00pm - Lunch.  Didn't do startup work on my lunch break because I had to run some errands.
