title: Jose Mourinho As Tactician (And What's Wrong With Football Writing)
---
<p>Last night, as the UEFA Champions League group stage kicked off, Spanish champions <a href="http://www.realmadrid.com/">Real Madrid</a> played English champions <a href="http://www.mcfc.co.uk/">Manchester City</a> at the Santiago Bernab√©u Stadium in Madrid, Spain. I expected it to be an awkward game [<a href="#1">1</a>], but I don't think I could have predicted the 3-2 scoreline, nor <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2012/sep/18/real-madrid-manchester-city-champions-league">the manner</a> of Real's last-minute victory.  It was a fun game to watch: plenty of goals, lots of hustle, very little play-acting.</p>

<p>So then this morning I read an article on ESPN Soccernet titled <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/feature/_/id/1163899/mourinho-playing-a-dangerous-game?cc=5901">Mourinho playing a dangerous game</a>. Dermot Corrigan's thesis is, in essence, "last night's victory shows that Jose Mourinho, while a good motivator and man-manager, is not a top-level football tactician".  Once I figured out what Mr. Corrigan was on about, my emotions went from mild surprise, to amusement, to disgust.</p>

<a name="1"></a><p>1 - Group D is certainly <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/round/_/groupId/4/league/uefa.champions/seasonType/5/uefa-champions-league?cc=5901">"The Group of Death"</a>, since it contains the Spanish, English, German, and Dutch champions. Real Madrid are already <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2012/sep/17/real-madrid-sevilla-la-liga">eight points</a> behind Barcelona.  Their megastar forward, Cristiano Ronaldo, <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/real-madrid/9517157/Cristiano-Ronaldo-sad-at-Real-Madrid-and-upset-with-people-in-the-club-after-choosing-not-to-celebrate-goals.html">recently claimed he was "sad"</a> for unknown reasons. Manchester City won the Premier League on the final day of the 2011/2012 season, did not make it out of the group stage in the Champions League last year, despite an expensively assembled squad full of superstars (and Gareth Barry).  Indeed, one of the knocks against City manager Roberto Mancini is that he's weak in Europe.  So on one hand, there was pressure on both teams: for Madrid, to right ship, and find form after their early season wobble. For City, and more specifically Mancini, it was an opportunity to prove they can hang with the big boys of Europe.</p>

<p>Finally, beneath all of that, is the fact that Mourinho took over at Inter Milan from Roberto Mancini in 2008, and went on to win the Champions League in 2010.  He was brought in to win in Europe, and he did.  There have been rumors that Mourinho could take over at City from Mancini in the near future, if Mancini fails to win the Champions League.  So there's that.</p>
