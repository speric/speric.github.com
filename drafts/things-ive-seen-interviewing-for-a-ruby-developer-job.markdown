title: My Experiences Interviewing For A Ruby Developer Position
---
<p>In the last year, I've done some interviews with start-ups for Ruby developer positions (and one Python position) of varying seniority.  The process has been humbling and enlightening.  I thought it would be helpful to post about my experiences here.  My purpose is to give aspiring Ruby devs an idea of what might await them in a startup interview, as well as point them in the direction of helpful resources for self improvement.</p>

<p>I've also been asked, as part of the interview process, to do some coding exercises. I was never asked to sign an NDA with respect to any of the questions or coding exercises.  Even so, out of respect for the integrity of each company's interview process, I will not name specific startups and I will be intentionally vague about some of the details of each exercise.</p>

  </li>
  <li>
  	<b>What is the difference between '&&' and 'and' operators?</b>
  </li>
  <li>
  	<b>What does <code>a ||= b</code> mean?</b>
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Talk about some of the differences between Ruby 1.8 and 1.9 with respect to the scope of variables within blocks.</b>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>The Rails Framework</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
  	<b>What is MVC? Explain how Rails implements the MVC pattern.</b>
  </li>
  <li>
  	<b>What are some ways you might refactor a large model?</b>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Miscellaneous Questions</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
  	<b>How would I create a symlink?</b>
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Explain where might see a closure in Javascript</b>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Coding/Thought Exercises</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    <b>Build a to-do list application</b><br/>
    I was given a couple of hours (on my own) to build a to-do list app using any technology I chose.
  <li>
  <li>
    <b>How would you solve the <a href="http://instagram-engineering.tumblr.com/post/12651721845/instagram-engineering-challenge-the-unshredder"></a>Unshredder Challenge?</b><br/>
    This was not asked during an interview with Instagram (I wish). This question really threw me off.  The interviewer wasn't looking for even a pseduo-code solution.  He just wanted to talk through how we might solve something like this from a really high level. I wasn't prepared for something along these lines, so it took me a minute to get into that headspace.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>How would you build our product?</b><br/>
    I was asked this during an interview with a startup whose product I use regularly.  Their technical challenges are as much in the architecture their whole system than the actual front-end product that people use.  I don't want to be more specific than that.  But the point is, it's probably a good idea to think about how you'd build (architect) the product of the startup you're interviewing with, from a high level.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>How would you build this feature?</b><br/>
    Different company, but same idea.  I was given mock-ups of a feature they were building, and asked to describe the data structures and actions I would use to enable that feature to be built.
  </li>
</ul>
